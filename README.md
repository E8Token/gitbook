# Project Vision & Mission

The main goal of the **Energy8** project is to **implement cryptocurrency and NFT deposit/withdrawal systems into any existing Web2.0 game**, providing a B2B solution for game server owners (or game developers) and B2C solutions for crypto enthusiasts and gamers.

Our **Energy8** Cryptocurrencies Bridge solution **works using a decentralized game node system, based on Proof-Of-Stake mechanism.**&#x20;

**New games implementation process is very easy**, because of our ready-made algorithm and SDK.

It's not required **** to interact with smart contracts and other technologies to start, since **our solution is universal and supports all Web 2.0 games**.

Deposits and Withdrawals of cryptocurrencies work on our website application: [app.energy8.io/bridge](https://app.energy8.io/bridge). So, **any user or developer without experience in cryptocurrencies can use Energy8 bridge solution.**
