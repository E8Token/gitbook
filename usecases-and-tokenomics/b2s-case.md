Energy8 project supports&#x20;

Each holder of governance token $8DAO will be able to stake their tokens, starting from N amount, into a special pool in order to rent a game node. Price of a game node will depend on the count of rented game nodes. Holders of game nodes will receive a fee from deposits/withdrawals of in-game currency. Reward size for nodes will depend on the number of staked tokens and TPS (Transactions Per Second).

On servers/games that support our technology, players will be able to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies. Players can buy and sell goods ​​for in-game currency pegged to the $E8 in-game token.
