# B2B Case

Energy8 project provides B2B solution **for all Web2.0 and Web3.0 games and community game servers.**

**Implementation with new games is very easy**, because we have ready-made algorithm and SDK.

It's not required **** to interact with smart contracts and other technologies to start, since **our solution is universal and supports all Web 2.0 games**.

Server owners **will be able to set commission for input/output** and attract much more donations and players due to the possibility of withdrawal.

For implementation of our solution, **we charge an installation fee**. For the first partners, **we are considering special conditions**, but as the Energy8 ecosystem is growing, the fee will increase.
