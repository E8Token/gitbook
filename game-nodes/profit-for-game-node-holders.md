# Profit for Game Node Holders

For each processed transaction for Input/Output To/From games or game servers, **the Energy8 project takes a 2% fee, most of which goes to the owner of the game node.** Thus, for example with **$100 million monthly** **volume of deposits/withdrawals**, and **100 game nodes**, each node holder will earn **\~$10.000 per month**.

Also, **DAO privileges are provided to all game node owners**. For example, NFT collection whitelists for games supported by Energy8, season/battle pass discounts, higher APR on staking and much more.
