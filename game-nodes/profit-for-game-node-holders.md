# Profit for Game Node Holders

For each processed transaction for Input/Output To/From games or game servers, **the Energy8 project takes a 2% fee, most of which goes to owner of the game node.**

Thus, for example with a monthly **volume of deposits/withdrawals of $100 million**, and **count of game nodes is 100**, each node holder will earn **\~$10.000 per month**.
