# Why did we choose a Game Node System?

There are important advantages of using a game node system:

1. **Decentralization** - The system operation depends on agents that process transactions, which means the system doesnâ€™t have an owner. The Energy8 project is moving towards full decentralization, when the functional working of its network will depend on the system of game nodes and validators of the main network, using POS mechanism.
2. **Security** - During token deposit/withdrawal to/from game servers, the game nodes check all the necessary conditions for the transaction, which well increases the system security without creating unique addresses and other operations.
3. **High transaction speed** - Due to the huge amount of servers and players, the system of game nodes will operate at high speed, as a huge count of agents will process transactions.
