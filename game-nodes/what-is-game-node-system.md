# What is Game Node System?

Game node system is a **decentralized system of agents, that processes transactions coming from game routers.**

**Each game node is assigned to an agent (holder)**, who has staked _N(TBA)_ $8DAO tokens into a special pool, **so transactions are processed according to the proof-of-stake mechanism**. But the **processing priority is round-robin** - a distribution algorithm in which the freest node will be selected for processing.

If there are **more transactions than the nodes are able to process** at the current moment, then **they form a queue**. Depending on the network load, the price for each node will rise or fall.

If the holder stakes _N+K tokens_, where _K\<H_, then _K_ tokens will receive interest according to the default staking pool. **But if it stakes **_**2N tokens**_**, it will receive income from two nodes.**
