# Governing Law

The Agreement and any matters related to it shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Marshall Islands. You irrevocably agree that, subject as provided below, the courts of the Marshall Islands shall have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to any claim, dispute or difference concerning the Agreement and any matter arising therefrom and irrevocably waive any right that it may have to object to an action being brought in those courts, or to claim that the action has been brought in an inconvenient forum, or that those courts do not have jurisdiction. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit **Energy8**'s right to bring proceedings against you in any other court of competent jurisdiction, nor shall the taking of proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of proceedings in any other jurisdictions, whether concurrently or not, to the extent permitted by the law of such other jurisdiction.
