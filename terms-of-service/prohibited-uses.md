2. EXPLOITS & BUGS. The Service is provided as is, and any exploitation of the Service or errors in program logic and/or code (i.e. bugs) constitutes a Prohibited Use and a material breach of this Agreement. Any funds that the user may misappropriate in this way in accordance with this paragraph shall be considered null and void and shall be the immediate property of **Energy8** without limitation.
3. JURISDICTIONS.
